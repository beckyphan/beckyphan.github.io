As I journey into becoming a full stack web developer, I trek onward for many reasons.

For one, I believe learning is a such beautiful thing. The capacity for our minds to learn new skills is amazing. I love to always be learning and doing things, and I hope I never lose that motivation to do more, be more, and constantly evolve.

My background is in microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics. I graduated from UCLA and moved to NYC to work in clinical research where I continue to seek answers to questions on drug safety and efficacy, and manage trials in precision medicine.

Dabbling in web development was initially prompted by my urge to showcase my creativity--photos, crafts, and projects that I wanted to have a little home. HTML and CSS were learning experiences I took on in order to make a little web site. As I learned more through development of my various hobbies and was also introduced to an inkling of the capacity of what web development through work, I decided that I want to be in on the action. So here I am!

```
"Hello, World!"
```

Picking up the various programming languages and skills reminds me of the process of learning Italian and French after being taught Spanish--there's this familiarity despite the differences. What is most important for me to achieve fluency will be continued practice.

I'm excited to come back here one day and read this snapshot into my thoughts on these early beginnings. In truth, this is just the next chapter of never-ending expedition. Graduation from Flatiron's curriculum will be a springboard forward in my grand journey to constantly be better, do more, solve more problems, help more people, and hopefully make impactful contributions to society.
